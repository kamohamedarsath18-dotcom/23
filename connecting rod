Introduction to Connecting Rods
A connecting rod is a critical component in internal combustion engines. It links the piston to the crankshaft, transmitting combustion force into rotational motion. Without it, the conversion of linear piston movement into usable rotary power wouldn’t be possible.
Key Functions:
•	Transfers combustion force from piston to crankshaft
•	Converts reciprocating motion into rotary motion
•	Maintains alignment between piston and crankshaft
 




Types of Connecting Rods
Different engine designs use different rod types:
•	Plain Rods – Standard design in most engines
•	Fork and Blade Rods – Used in V-type engines to share a crankpin
•	Master and Slave Rods – Found in radial engines
•	Billet Rods – Machined from solid metal, very strong
•	Cast Rods – Economical, made by casting
