## Camshaft – Summary
### 🔧 Main Function

* Opens and closes engine valves at the correct time.
* Ensures proper air–fuel intake and exhaust gas release.
* Synchronizes with the crankshaft (usually via timing belt, chain, or gears).

---

### ⚙️ How It Works

* The camshaft rotates at **half the speed of the crankshaft** in a 4-stroke engine.
* Each cam lobe pushes a valve open as it rotates.
* When the lobe turns away, the valve spring closes the valve.

### 🏗️ Types of Camshaft Arrangements

1. **OHV (Overhead Valve)** – Camshaft located inside the engine block.
2. **SOHC (Single Overhead Camshaft)** – One camshaft in the cylinder head.
3. **DOHC (Double Overhead Camshaft)** – Two camshafts in the cylinder head (better performance and efficiency).

### 📌 Key Parts

* Cam lobes
* Bearings
* Journals
* Timing gear
* Shaft body

### 🚗 Importance

* Affects engine power, fuel efficiency, and performance.
* Performance camshafts can increase horsepower by changing valve timing and lift.

---

### 🛠️ Common Problems

* Worn cam lobes
* Timing issues
* Noisy engine (ticking sound)
* Reduced engine performance
